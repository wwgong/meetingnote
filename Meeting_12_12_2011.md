#Meeting note on 12/12/11.

## Escrow ##

### Escrow Data ###
1. Structure: (table\_name, identifier)
  * identifier has (inf, val, sup)
  * identifier can be PK value

2. Only stored in ES

3. Add new ED when Escrow-able txn coming, delete ED when no txn existing operating on this ED.

### Escrow Journal ###
1. Stored both in ES and MPPTS.

  * MPPTS: track journals by txid
```
(index, table_name, identifier, type)

Type: EU, Ins, Del
         there are more fields relating to each type
```

  * ES: summarize journals on each ES
```
(txid, inner_identifier)

inner_identifier: index of journals in its MPPTS
```

2. Kepp EJ only when its tx is running and not completed.

### Predicate Read / Read ###
1. Need a new Q

  * transactionQueue: priority Q with all not started tx's

  * startedQueue: it's m\_multiPartitionReadyTxnQueue in current design; one txn is put in this Q when it's a SPTS or its fragments has distributed (at least first shot).

  * runningQueue: it's currentTxnState in original VoltDB design; when one txn starts to process its fragments, it should be in this Q

  * waitingQueue: when its next operation is blocked by other txn (with smaller txnid), it should be in this Q and wait the notification of blocking txn.

## Tuple Identifier ##

1. There is table without PK in VoltDB.

2. In EE, PersisitentTable represents tables. The data is of type TBMap.

  * TBMap is a B tree, each node of it is a pair <char**, TBPtr>, where char** represents the address of its corresponding TBPtr, which points to a TupleBlock.

  * In each TupleBlock, one tuple is identified by the offset.

  * All TBPtr consist a B tree set called TBBucket.
