Meeting minutes for Meeting#3.

= Design =

=== MySQL ===
    * no user defined data type
    * can explicitly lock and unlock tables, but one session must acquire all locks it needs in one single "LOCK TABLES" statement

==== Tables ===
    * T(PK, inf, val, sup)
    * T'(TxID, PK, low, high, timestamp, status)

=== Sequences ===
    # Check whether new request satisfies constraints of T' or not.
    # Lock T; update 'inf', 'val', and 'sup' on T; release lock; and then immediately S lock T.
    # Insert into T' with new TxID.
    # Commit/Abort.
         * Get X lock on T and T'.
         * Update 'inf' and 'sup' on T, and as well as 'status' on T'.
         * Release all locks.
