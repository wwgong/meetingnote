#Meeting minutes of Meeting#11. 

= Meeting Note =
1. Debug MySQL.
  * use Eclipse CDT on Linux
  * or use Visual Studio on Windows

2. Modify 1st design.
  * redesign structure "escrow": move to structure "que_bue"? or remove some unnecessary fields?
  * Explore spinlock supported in MySQL
  



= Action Points =

1. Debug MySQL in Eclipse.

  * First, run "./configure --prefix=/your/path --with-debug --with-plugins=innobase".
     * *Note: the configure option "--with-innodb" listed in MySQL documentation is not recognizable by MySQL*

  * Create an empty Eclipse C++ project, reference link: [http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Eclipse/CDT_on_Linux_and_Mac_OS_X#Things_I_haven.27t_figured_out_yet Create Eclipse Project] 
    * Link the source code with project: "New" -> "Folder" -> "Advanced" -> "Link to folder in the file system" and choose directory and click "Finish" button. 
    * In the "Properties" -> "C/C++ Build" view disable "Makefile generation"

  * Build the project
    * Choose "Debug" configuration for project
    * Build all

  * Pre-setup for debugging.
    * Running "scripts/mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &" in a command prompt
    * Running "client/.libs/mysql --user=mysql" in another command prompt
    * Set password for one user(eg. root)
    * Create a table using "ENGINE=INNODB" option and insert some records
    * Stopping "mysqld" server

  * Running project
    * Create a debug configuration of mysql
    * Start "mysqld" inside Eclipse(with debug mode)
    * Running "mysql" outside of Eclipse to connect to "mysqld" started in previous step
    * Set breakpoints

  * Things haven't figured out
    * The default password of user "mysql" and "root" doesn't work after initialized databse



2. Debug MySQL in Visual Studio.
  * Mainly followed this documentation, [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/windows-source-build.html Install from Source Code on Windows]
    * *Note: Currently MySQL doesn't support Visual Studio 2010*
      * Create another .bat file under directory PATH/win/build-vs10.bat with follow command
         * cmake -G "Visual Studio 10"
    * Need to install ActivePerl to run test scripts, since cygwin doesn't automatically support perl.
  
  * Error: "LINK: fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file Debug\sql.lib"
     * haven't figured out how to solve it

3. Redesign. 

4. Spinlock in MySQL.
