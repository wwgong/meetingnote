# External Procedure from within Oracle #

2. External Java method is also available [Load Java](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B14117_01/appdev.101/b10795/adfns_ex.htm#1006327) on Oracle10g Manual, but not as strong as C function, especially if want to use shared memory, since Java doesn't have real shared memory.
