= Group Commit in MySQL =

At first, I thought MySQL doesn't support group commit in its storage engines, but it turns out its statically-linked storage engine InnoDB doesn't support it, but additional upgraded 
InnoDB Plugin does support it from 1.0.4.([http://dev.mysql.com/doc/innodb-plugin/1.0/en/innodb-performance-group_commit.html Introduction in MySQL Docs])

I found this when I was trying to get understand how group commit works in PostgreSQL, there is post mentioned comparison between PostgreSQL and InnoDB.
